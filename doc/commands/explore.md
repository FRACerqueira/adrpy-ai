# `adrpy explore`

Lists every decision file in the repository, on a best-effort basis.

## Description

Lists every decision file in the repository, recognized or not, on a best-effort basis: a file excluded for escaping the repository boundary, a subdirectory that could not be scanned, or a single file that could not be read are all reported via `warnings` instead of silently missing from `decisions` or failing the whole command. Each entry's `header.state` is `valid`, `adulterated` (it looks like this tool's header -- a `|Adr-Plus ` row, an exact `|--|--|` line or a NUL byte within the first 12 lines -- but it does not parse) or `no-header`, with `header.invalid_reason` naming the parse failure for the last two -- a file that is not `valid` has no status the other commands can read, so they leave it out of every family rule (see doc/lifecycle.md). May fail with target-directory-not-found if --path does not point to an existing directory, or config-not-found if that directory has no adr-config.adrplus -- these two are hard failures, not part of the best-effort reporting above, since there is no repository to scan at all yet.

## Arguments

### `--path` / `-p` *(required, string)*

Repository root directory (must contain adr-config.adrplus).

## Failure codes

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `target-directory-not-found` | --path does not point to an existing directory. |
| `config-not-found` | --path's own directory has no adr-config.adrplus. |
| `path-invalid` | A resolved path is not usable (e.g. contains a NUL byte). |
| `path-outside-repository` | A resolved path escapes the repository boundary. |
| `config-file-too-large` | The config file exceeds the 64KB size limit. |
| `config-invalid-encoding` | The config file's bytes are not valid UTF-8. |
| `config-invalid-json` | The config file is not valid JSON, or its root is not a JSON object. |
| `config-missing-field` | The config is missing one or more required fields. |
| `config-unexpected-field` | The config has one or more fields this schema does not recognize. |
| `config-wrong-type` | A field's value is not the type this schema requires for it (string/integer/boolean/array of strings). |
| `config-lenseq-too-small` | lenseq is below its configured minimum (3). |
| `config-lenseq-too-large` | lenseq is above its configured maximum (6). |

| `config-lenversion-too-large` | lenversion is above its configured maximum (4). |
| `config-lenrevision-negative` | lenrevision is below its configured minimum (0). |
| `config-lenrevision-too-large` | lenrevision is above its configured maximum (3). |
| `config-separator-invalid` | separator is not one of ('-', '_', '.'). |
| `config-casetransform-invalid` | casetransform is not one of the recognized case-transform names. |
| `config-field-empty` | A field that must be non-empty is an empty string. |
| `config-prefix-invalid` | prefix is not ASCII letters only, max 5 characters. |
| `config-folderadr-too-long` | folderadr exceeds 50 characters. |
| `config-folderadr-not-relative` | folderadr is absolute, drive-relative, or a UNC path -- it must be relative to the repository. |
| `config-folderlog-too-long` | folderlog exceeds 50 characters. |
| `config-folderlog-not-relative` | folderlog is absolute, drive-relative, or a UNC path -- it must be relative to the repository. |
| `config-folderadr-folderlog-overlap` | folderadr and folderlog are the same directory, or one is nested inside the other. |
| `config-template-too-long` | template exceeds 10000 characters. |
| `config-headerdisclaimer-too-long` | headerdisclaimer exceeds 100 characters. |
| `config-field-is-blank` | A field is non-empty but blank after stripping whitespace. |
| `config-field-contains-forbidden-character` | A field contains '\|' or a line-break-like character (or, for the 4 status labels, '(', ')', '<!--', '-->', or ':'; or, for headertablefields/headertablevalues, '<!--' or '-->'). |
| `config-migrationpattern-invalid` | migrationpattern is non-empty but does not match N##:##T##[V##:##][R##:##][P##:##]. |
