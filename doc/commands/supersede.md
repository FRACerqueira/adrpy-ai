# `adrpy supersede`

Marks an `Accepted` decision `Superseded` and creates its successor.

## Description

Marks an Accepted decision as Superseded and creates its successor. Refuses with family-member-superseded if another member of the same family has already been superseded, or family-member-pending if another member is still unresolved (Proposed) -- no write is made either way. This is two writes in sequence, not one: a failure creating the successor (supersede-successor-write-failed) means success=false even though the predecessor was already committed to Superseded -- that code's own `data.predecessor`/`data.predecessor_status` names the file already mutated despite the overall failure (a lock lost before this SECOND write also surfaces this same code/data, not lock-lost). May instead fail with repository-locked (lock never acquired) or lock-lost (lost before the FIRST write) -- in both of those cases no write was made at all. May also fail with folderadr-changed-after-lock-acquired if a concurrent config change moved folderadr while this call was acquiring the lock -- no write was made either way; retry. May also fail with family-scan-incomplete or supersede-successor-scan-incomplete if a subdirectory under the decisions folder could not be scanned (permission denied or similar) -- family membership and successor-number allocation can't be trusted from an incomplete scan; no write was made either way. The predecessor's own title (re-read from its filename, not a flag) is re-validated before use -- may fail with field-contains-forbidden-character if a hand-edited or migrated predecessor's title carries '|', a line-break-like character, or a filesystem-unsafe character (`<>:"/\|?*` or a control character; the successor's title lands inside an actual filename component, not just a header-table cell); no write is made.

## Arguments

### `--file` / `-f` *(required, string)*

Path to the decision file. A bare name with no extension gets '.md' appended.

### `--domain` / `-d` *(optional, string)*

Domain for the successor; defaults to the predecessor's own value. Cannot contain '|' or a line-break-like character (field-contains-forbidden-character), or be blank (field-is-blank).

### `--scope` / `-s` *(optional, string)*

Scope for the successor; defaults to the predecessor's own value. Cannot contain '|' or a line-break-like character (field-contains-forbidden-character), or be blank (field-is-blank).

### `--refdate` / `-r` *(optional, string)*

Reference date (YYYY-MM-DD); defaults to today. Must not be in the future or before the predecessor's own last update date (or creation date, if never updated) (refdate-invalid-format/refdate-in-future/refdate-before-history).

## Example

```bash
adrpy supersede --file doc/adr/ADR001V01-use-postgre-sql-for-the-primary-datastore.md --refdate 2026-09-18
```
